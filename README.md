# Toy-And-Learn-Swift ðŸš‚ ðŸ§¸ ðŸ§’
An app that allows you to explore kids' toys and read articles about the kids health

<h3>Why this project?</h3>
This project is open-ended, so it provides an opportunity for me to showcase my iOS abilities. It allows me to make expressive, engaging user interfaces, and to gather and generate compelling data. 

<h3>What I learned from this project?</h3>
<ul>    
    <li>Researching and leveraging a new framework or library
    <li>How to design and build an app from the ground up
    <li>Finding sources of networked data
</ul>
